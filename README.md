<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We are the **Pull & Bear clothing team** from [Strive School](https://strive.school/). As part of the ongoing **AI Engineering specialization program**, this project is geared towards applying knowledge from the Deep learning module (Neural network) to solving a real life challenge. The Fashion MNIST challenge is what we are testing our skills on... We will build a neural network model on the pytorch library that accurately classifies fashion images on a scale of 0 classes. You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/notebooks)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Data Description

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Data was collected by Zalando(a popular German fashion online retail store) to reduce precious time wasted by employees everytime a product is returned by the customer for numerous reason.

The dataset was developed by a [team of collaborators from the Univsersity of Bologna](https://tempesta.cs.unibo.it/projects/us-tm2017/tutorial.html#raw_data), and is based on 13 users who collected the data during their daily activities. The dataset includes all sensors available in phones such as accelerometer, gyrometer, etc., and distinguishes five transportation modes: 
Labels

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

/ 0 T-shirt/top
/ 1 Trouser
/ 2 Pullover
/ 3 Dress
/ 4 Coat
/ 5 Sandal
/ 6 Shirt
/ 7 Sneaker
/ 8 Bag
/ 9 Ankle boot


### Goal of this project
* Our goal is to build a machine learning algoriths that accurately classifies a fashion article as much as possible.  


## Project plan

* Download and pre-process the data according to our needs
* Create Machine Learning pipeline and run the data on multiple classifiers
* Choose the best classifier and find the accuracy on test_data
* Create a time series model which predicts the class for every 1 sec
* Calculate necessary parameters like speed, calorie count etc.
