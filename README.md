<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We are the **Pull & Bear clothing team** from [Strive School](https://strive.school/). As part of the ongoing **AI Engineering specialization program**, this project is geared towards applying knowledge from the Deep learning module (Neural network) to solving a real life challenge. The Fashion MNIST challenge is what we are testing our skills on... We will build a neural network model on the pytorch library that accurately classifies fashion images on a scale of 0 classes. You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/notebooks)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Data Description

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Data was collected by [Zalando](zalando.com) (a popular German fashion online retail store) to reduce precious time wasted by employees everytime a product is returned by the customer for numerous reason.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

/ 0. T-shirt/top
/ 1. Trouser
/ 2. Pullover
/ 3. Dress
/ 4. Coat
/ 5. Sandal
/ 6. Shirt
/ 7. Sneaker
/ 8. Bag
/ 9. Ankle boot


### Goal of this project
* Our goal is to build a machine learning algoriths that accurately classifies a fashion article as much as possible.  


## Project plan

* Download and pre-process the data according to our needs
* Build a Neural Network classifier in Pytorch for classifying the clothes in the Fashion-MNIST Dataset to achieve a test accuracy > 0.95
* Visualize the loss behaviour over time for the training and the validation set
* Inspect the samples that have been misclassified
* Build an awesome Readme or deploy an app on Streamlit that given a clothing image as input classifies it in a Fashion-MNIST fashion (pun intended).
